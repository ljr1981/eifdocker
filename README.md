# Eiffel Docker Utility
WARNING: This GUI Linux-based utility is a work-in-progress and will be changing rapidly.

## Overview
The goal is to have a GUI-based "wizard" to help guide and remember Docker ECS settings. The basis for this can be found at: https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/ecs-integration

Command line and scripts are great, but I do not easily remember these over the long term. Having a GUI-based utility spares me some of the burden of having to remember or re-read notes over and over. I want to learn it once and remember it in code, where the utility and its code are my actionable notes.
